# Lego-Printer-Project

Using Lego Mindstorms EV3 Robotics kit a printer can be made and the file Print.m can be run on MATLAB to execute the printing.
The printer was designed to be binary colour so any image that is binary can replace the pakistan.png image.
The rotation angles and speeds have to be calibrated by trial and error and is specific to the type of pen being used.
